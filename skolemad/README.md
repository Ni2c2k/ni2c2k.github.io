# What is that?
The purpose of [the 'skolemad' page](https://ni2c2k.github.io/skolemad/) is to create an iCalendar file with orders from [eat.kk.dk](https://eat.kk.dk).

## How to use
When you order food on eat.kk.dk you receive an email with your order details.

Copy the email message and paste it into the text area - if everything is ok you will be able to download an .ics file and import it into your calendar app.
